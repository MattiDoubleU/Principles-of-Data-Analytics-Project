## About this project

This project is the [assessment](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/2324_principles_of_data_analytics/) for the Principles of Data Analytics module. It focuses on the widely available [palmerpenguins data set](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data/master/penguins.csv).
The data set is an excellent base to explore and demonstrate the following items as per assessment instruction:

    1. Source and investigate sets of data.
    2. Programmatically explore and visualize data.
    3. Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets.
    4. Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.
    5. Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.
    6. Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.


## Use of This Project

The project serves as an analysis of the correlation between two select variables from the data set. 


## Tools

For data frames: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. 

For plotting: [Metplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/) is a comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

For numerical arrays: [Numpy](https://numpy.org/). The fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.


Table of content, analysis and references can be found in the jupyter notebook. All credits go to Dr. Kristen Gorman who collected the data and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER, a member of the Long Term Ecological Research Network as well as Allison Horst whose work this project is inspired by.
